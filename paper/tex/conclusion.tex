 In this paper, we contribute a GPU-centric design for visual exploration of big data. We emphasize the GPU platform for storing and processing data by fully exploiting the GPU resources. In addition, we propose a data dependency graph design to character data computation on the GPU. 
 
 As a proof of concept, we implement AVIST based on our design. We highlight animation and cross-filtering interactions for slicing big data into fine details, and parallel computation for generating visual primitives. The code organization follows MVC pattern, and it shows the detailed GPU data transformation of four data views. 
  
 We demonstrate how AVIST help analysts to gain insights of big data within two usage scenarios.  Lastly, we summarize the lessons learned, discuss the trade-offs of different techniques for designing big data visual analysis systems.

This paper presents  AVIST, an exploration oriented data visualization tool that  enables rapidly exploring and filtering large time-series multidimensional datasets on a commodity desktop computer.  AVIST highlights data exploration by gaining fine data details, which is achieved by animation and cross filtering interactions. To support interactive and visual exploration of big data, AVIST features a GPU-centric design.  Two key aspects are emphasized on this GPU-centric design: 1) data storage and computing are both on the GPU to fully utilize its parallel computing capability and fast memory bandwidth; 2) a directed acyclic graph for characterizing data transformations on the GPU to support data aggregations and visualizations based on user demands. Moreover, the implementation of AVIST follows the MVC pattern, and focuses on 1) user interactions to slice big data into small and 2) data transformations based on the parallel computing. Finally we present two case studies to demonstrate how AVIST can help analysts to identify abnormal behaviors and infer new hypotheses in the exploration of big datasets.}

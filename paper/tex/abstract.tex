This paper presents  AVIST, an exploration oriented data visualization tool that  enables rapidly exploring and filtering large time-series multidimensional datasets on a commodity desktop computer.  AVIST highlights data exploration by gaining fine data details, which is achieved by animation and cross filtering interactions. To interactive visual exploration of big data, AVIST features a GPU-centric design.  Two key ideas are emphasized on the GPU-centric design: 1) data storage and computing are both on the GPU to fully utilize GPUs parallel computing and fast memory bandwidth; 2) a directed acyclic graph for characterizing data transformations on the GPU to support data aggregations and visualizations on users' demands. Based on the proposed designs, AVIST is implemented following the MVC pattern, and  focuses on 1) user interactions to slice big data into small  and 2) data transformations based  on the parallel computing. Lastly, two case studies are demonstrated that AVIST can help analysts identify abnormal behaviors and infer new hypotheses for visually exploring big datasets.}

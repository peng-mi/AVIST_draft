%We admit that this kind of design is limited by GPU memory size, and it can not handle big data scaled to terabyte. The out-of-core technique is our future, which utilizes main memory and focus on data transform between GPU memory and main memory. Better data compression techniques are the potential solutions for scaling big data in GPU.

%The main contribution of this paper is the \emph{in-situ}
%We borrow the \emph{in-situ} concept from scientific visualization filed, and present a GPU based in-situ visualization architecture, which features the computing and rendering running simultaneously to reduce I/O costs. To utilize powerful GPU resources,

%We presented AVIST system - a GPU based animation visualization toolkit for exploratory visual analysis large time-series and multidimensional dataset.

%p1: contribution what we did, and why it is useful, point 1, point 2, combined together
%p2: future work

%Firstly, analysts can specify animation speed and time window size (120 seconds in this example) to play animation. Dynamic view provides the overview of one week's network flow in subgraph 1. Analysts find there is no any network data during 4-2-2013 9:40 am to 4-3-2013 3:26 am, which  indicates that the whole network had been crushed. To investigate the details, analysts choose source ip and port, destination ip and port to generate parallel coordinate view in subgraph 2. Analysts then play animation again and find unusual pattern in subgraph 3. Analysts identify this pattern's details using highlight filters, and they find that machine 172.30.0.4 was trying to scan three machine during 4-2-2013 5:20 am.  However, visualization of parallel coordinate view are always over-cluttered. In histogram view of subgraph 4, analyst find most of network flow are from port 80. These network flow may be normal to access company's webpage. Analysts apply exclusive filters to remove the network logs, which had access 80 port in subgraph 5. Subgraph 6 shows that analysts use different color to highlight source ips to reveal the port scan behavior in subgraph 7. Figure \ref{fig:views} shows the whole picture of  port scan behavior. After analysts highlight three suspicious ips, they play animation again to identify the behavior distribution in histogram view and dynamic view. They find that the port scan may be a periodical behavior and it happens in TCP transactions. These information may infer analysts next interaction to query more.
